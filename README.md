# KFactory 0.23.1

Kfactory is a [gdsfactory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory)-like tool. It is built with [KLayout](https://klayout.de) as a backend instead of gdstk, but aims to offer the similar features.

> [!CAUTION]
> KFactory is still experimental
> Expect API changes without notice (even though we try to keep it to a minimum!). The core should be fairly stable with the exception of the all-angle router.
> It is likely to change in future releases

It is suggest to pin the version of KFactory in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with `kfactory==0.23.1` for example.

Features similar to gdsfactory:

- [x] Cells & decorator for caching & storing cells
- [x] Simple routing (point to point and simpl bundle routes for electrical routes)
- [x] Basic cells like euler/circular bends, taper, waveguide
- [x] Path extrusion (no interface with CrossSections)
- [x] Jupyter integration
- [x] PDK/package configuration
- [x] Plugin system (simulations etc.) - Check [kplugins](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kplugins)
- [x] Generic PDK example - Check [kgeneric](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kgeneric)


Notable missing Features:

- [ ] CrossSection
- [ ] Netlist/Schematics and LVS
- [ ] More advanced routing


New/Improved Features:

- Fully hierarchical bi-directional conversion to YAML
- Automatic snapping to grid thanks to KLayout
- More features for vector geometries due to concept of Point/Edge/Vector/Polygon from Klayout
- Easy booleans thanks to KLayout Regions
- Enclosures: use the concept of enclosures, similar to cross sections, to allow automatic
  calculation of boolean layers for structures based on [minkowski sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition),
  which are built into KLayout
