# KFactory 1.4.4

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/gdsfactory/kfactory/graph/badge.svg?token=dArcfnQE4w)](https://codecov.io/gh/gdsfactory/kfactory)

Kfactory is the backend for [gdsfactory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory). It is built upon [KLayout](https://klayout.de).
It offers basic operations like gdsfactory, so it can be used on its own as as layout tool as well.

It is recommended to pin the version of KFactory in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with `kfactory==1.4.4` for example.

Features similar to gdsfactory:

- [x] Cells & decorator for caching & storing cells
- [x] Simple routing (point to point and simpl bundle routes for electrical routes)
- [x] Basic cells like euler/circular bends, taper, waveguide
- [x] Path extrusion (no interface with CrossSections)
- [x] Jupyter integration
- [x] PDK/package configuration
- [x] Plugin system (simulations etc.) - Check [kplugins](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kplugins)
- [x] Generic PDK example - Check [kgeneric](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kgeneric)


Notable missing Features:

- [ ] CrossSection
- [ ] Netlist/Schematics and LVS
- [ ] More advanced routing


New/Improved Features:

- Fully hierarchical bi-directional conversion to YAML
- Automatic snapping to grid thanks to KLayout
- More features for vector geometries due to concept of Point/Edge/Vector/Polygon from Klayout
- Easy booleans thanks to KLayout Regions
- Enclosures: use the concept of enclosures, similar to cross sections, to allow automatic
  calculation of boolean layers for structures based on [minkowski sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition),
  which are built into KLayout
