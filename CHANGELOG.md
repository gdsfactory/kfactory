<a name="v0.6.0"></a>
# [0.6.0 (v0.6.0)](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kfactory/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 18 Apr 2023

# kcell.py
* KCell and Instance don´t  inherit from `kdb.Cell` / `kdb.Instance` anymore. They should still transparently proxy to them
* Ports automatically convert um <-> dbu
  * no more DPort/DCplxPort/ICplxPort

[Changes][v0.6.0]


<a name="v0.4.1"></a>
# [Fix (Cplx)KCell.dup (v0.4.1)](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kfactory/releases/tag/v0.4.1) - 24 Feb 2023

* `KCell` and `CplxKCell` are now properly copying their instances when copied using `dup` https://github.com/KLayout/klayout/issues/1300

[Changes][v0.4.1]


<a name="v0.4.0"></a>
# [Complex Cells (v0.4.0)](https://github.com/gdsfactory/kfactory/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 21 Feb 2023

* `CplxKCell`:
    * Use `DCplxPort` by default. These ports can have arbitrary angle and are micrometer based
      Any other port will be silently converted to `DCplxPort`
* `library` -> `klib`:
    Rename `kf.library` -> `kf.klib`, `kf.KCell.library` -> `kf.KCell.klib`, `kf.kcell.library` -> `kf.KCell.klib` in order to not confuse with the
    KLayout library and shadow it.
    
    Put deprecation warning and remove in 0.5.0
* `autocell`
    * move cache from `cachetools.Cache[int,Any]` to a dictionary `{}`
    * deprecate cache `maxsize` for 0.5.0: this is not necessary as a dictionary has infinite size and cache eviction is unwanted
