# Config

The config is managed by a pydantic [`SettingsModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/settings/). Entries can be set through changing `kfactory.config`

The config can configure the logger and display type of the jupyter widget among other things.

Setting can be configured through environment variables


## Logging

Logging is done through [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru). KFactory allows configuration of the log level.
The logger can be used to log the message to the console.

```python
kfactory.logger.debug("message {}, {}", var1, var2)
kfactory.logger.info(f"f-string message {var}")
```

### Logging Options

Below are some basic configurations available in kfactory. loguru also supports various
advanced ways to log, e.g. lazy evaluation for expensive functions, this is explained excellently here:
[docs](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#take-the-tour)

#### Show Function

The default show function can be overridden to allow usage in another framework, for example if klive/KLayout are not available.
If the show_function is set as a string, there is a validator which automatically imports the function. E.g. `"my_package.my_show_function"`
will automatically execute `from my_package import my_show_function`. The string must be an absolute import.


!!! warning

    If the show function is set as an environment variable, the custom show function **MUST NOT** contain any default values depending on kfactory as that will cause a circular import error due to the config being set up early on in the   initialization of kfactory. An example to solve this can look like the following:

    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations
    from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
    from pathlib import Path

    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        import kfactory


    def show(
        layout: kfactory.KCLayout | kfactory.KCell | Path | str,
        *,
        lyrdb: kfactory.rdb.ReportDatabase | Path | str | None = None,
        l2n: kfactory.kdb.LayoutToNetlist | Path | str | None = None,
        keep_position: bool = True,
        save_options: kfactory.kdb.SaveLayoutOptions | None = None,
        use_libraries: bool = True,
        library_save_options: kfactory.kdb.SaveLayoutOptions | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        import kfactory as kf

        if save_options is None:
            save_options = kf.save_layout_options()
        if library_save_options is None:
            library_save_options = kf.save_layout_options()
    ```

    This can then be used with `KFACTORY_SHOW_FUNCTION="custom.show.show" python ...`

#### Log Level

loguru can log in multiple levels. By default the following are available for kfactory

Available log levels are "TRACE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "SUCCESS", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL".

Log outputs can be filtered either by setting a minimum level or by regex. The minimum level is configured in `kfactory.config.logfilter.level`.
Instead of configuring it through python, it can also be configured from an environment variable. By default the log level is set to "INFO",
so anything below "INFO" is not sent to an output. This can be configured either by setting the level in python, through dotenv
([untested](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/settings/#dotenv-env-support)), or through environment variables.

| Logging Function                  | Minimum `kfactory.config.logfilter.level` |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `kfactory.logger.trace`    | `TRACE`                                   |
| `kfactory.logger.debug`    | `DEBUG`                                   |
| `kfactory.logger.info`     | `INFO`                                    |
| `kfactory.logger.success`  | `SUCCESS`                                 |
| `kfactory.logger.warning`  | `WARNING`                                 |
| `kfactory.logger.error`    | `ERROR`                                   |
| `kfactory.logger.critical` | `CRITICAL`                                |

Alternatively `kfactory.logger.log(level: str | int, message: str)` can be used.

Setting the loglevel through environment:

##### Linux/MacOS

```bash
export KFACTORY_LOGFILTER_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

This can of course also be done in a way which requires setting it only once. (under Linux/MacOS): `KFACTORY_LOGFILTER_LEVEL="DEBUG" python my_file.py`

##### Windows

```cmd
setx KFACTORY_LOGFILTER_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

### Using loguru to give more comprehensive traceback

loguru's logger offers a catch decorator to catch exceptions and give a more conprehensive traceback.

```python
import kfactory as kf


@kf.logger.catch
def test(x: int) -> None:
    if x != 42:
        raise ValueError(f"x is not 42, it's {x}")


def run_test(x: int) -> None:
    return test(x)


run_test(42)
run_test(20)
```

This will produce a traceback with infos about the values:

```
2023-05-31 17:56:45.816 | INFO     | kfactory.conf:__init__:105 - LogLevel: INFO
2023-05-31 17:56:45.890 | ERROR    | __main__:run_test:11 - An error has been caught in function 'run_test', process 'MainProcess' (28352), thread 'MainThread' (139734375601984):

  File "/home/sgoeldi/repos/kfactory/test.py", line 7, in test
    raise ValueError(f"x is not 42, it's {x}")
```

## Jupyter Widget

By default kfactory will provide a `IPython.Image` for notebooks. Instead of the image a simple interactive Jupyter widget may be used. The widget is not very performant and might impact performance for larger notebooks. 
It can be configured in `kfactory.config.display_type`. Available options are `widget` or `image`. For example, the docs that use `image` as the interactive widget will not work on a standard html page.

Similar to the log level this may also be configured through dotenv or an env variable.
`export KFACTORY_DISPLAY_TYPE="image"` will set it to display as image by default.
