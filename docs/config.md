# Config

The config is managed by a pydantic [`SettingsModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/settings/). Entries can be set either through changing `kfactory.conf`

The config can configure the logger and display type of the jupyter widget among other things.

Setting can be done through environment variables


## Logging

Logging is done through [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru). KFactory allows configuration of the log level.
The logger can be used to log message to the console.

```python
kfactory.conf.logger.debug("message {}, {}", var1, var2)
kfactory.conf.logger.info(f"f-string message {var}")
```

## Log Level

The logger's level can be set with `kfactory.conf.logfilter.level` or through environment variables, under linux for example

```bash
export KFACTORY_LOGFILTER__LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

Available levels are "TRACE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "SUCCESS", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
