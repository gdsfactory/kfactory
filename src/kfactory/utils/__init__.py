"""Utilities to provide geometrical, fill and DRC violation help.

:py:class:~`Enclosures can automatically generate slab and excludes based on minkowski
sums instead of only vector based sizing.

:py:func:~`fill_tiled` provides a filling algorithm that can use the
:py:class:~`klayout.db.TilingProcessor` to calculate the regions to fill.

:py:func:~`fix_spacing` uses a region space check to calculate areas that violate
min space violations. :py:func:~`fix_spacing_tiled` to fix it using a TilingProcessor.
